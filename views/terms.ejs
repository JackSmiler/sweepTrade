                            to the Site constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                            failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not
                            operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest
                            extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
                            at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure
                            to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a
                            provision of these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that
                            provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not
                            affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint
                            venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a
                            result of these Terms of Use or use of the Site. You agree that these Terms of Use will not
                            be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all
                            defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of
                            signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of Use.</p>
